This Nexys-A7 has been programmed to do addition in hexadecimal with inputs coming from the Pmod KYPD. The + operand is inputed via the BTNU button, the "=" operand is inputed via the BTNL button, and the "clear all" command is inputed via the BTNC button.

### Project 2: Modified Hex Calculator


Like the previous project this Nexys-A7 can provide calculations in hexadecimal but with the additional ability of subtraction.
